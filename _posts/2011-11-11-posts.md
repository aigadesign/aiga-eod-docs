## Titles and Sub Headings

### Title

The Post title should be no more than 8 words.

### Sub Heading

The sub heading is optional and should be no more than 12 words.

### Italics

You can add italics to a title by using the HTML <i></i> tags, e.g. Design <i>Diary</i> will make ‘Diary’ italicised.

## Featured Images and Galleries

You can choose to show either a featured image or a featured gallery at the top of a  post. If you have both a featured image and a featured gallery, only the featured image will be shown, so be sure to remove a featured image if you want to show a featured gallery.

Both featured images and featured galleries have size set heights and will retain their proportions, being no wider than 100% of the page. Very wide images will be cut off.
+ Mobile: Height set at 222px
+ Tablet: Height set at 450px
+ Laptop: Height set at 500px
+ Desktop: Height set at 550px

Given the maximum height is 550px we recommend you do not use images smaller than this to ensure they don’t look stretched. To accommodate for retina displays you should use images twice the size of this, 1100px.

## Inline Images

Inline images are only restricted by their natural size and the width of the viewport. They will automatically scale to be no wider than the viewport or their set size.

## Image Captions

Image captions are handled via the Wordpress media module. When you upload an image you can set the alt tag and the caption. It is recommended you should always include text for the alt tag for accessibility. Captions are optional and when populated they will display on both single images and gallery images.

## Thumbnail Images

Every post is required to have a thumbnail image. The Thumbnail image is used to display the post on the homepage, archive page, contributions page, category pages and in the related stories block.

You can choose to display the post thumbnail image as a circle, triangle or rectangle. You do not need to do anything special to the image it will be automatically cropped and adjusted when you upload it. 

Please ensure you do not upload images with transparent margins or padding as they will not appear as a solid shape when displayed on the site.

The maximum size of a thumbnail on the site is when the post is featured as a ‘Recent’ story on the homepage, therefore the images you upload should be appropriate for this space.

The sizes displayed in the ‘Recent’ stories section on the homepage are:

+ Circle: 400px wide by 400px high
+ Triangle: 462px wide by 400px high
+ Rectangle: 534px wide by 400px high

## Featured Slideshow Posts

A featured slideshow post is one that is displayed on the homepage in the carousel. When a post is featured it will not be displayed in any of the other post areas on the homepage.

To add a post to the slideshow edit the post and setting the  `Feature on homepage slideshow?` field to `Yes`.

The image you upload for the featured will be automatically sized to fill the entire space of the carousel and we recommend you use an image that is at least 500px high and 1200px wide.

The text you enter in the ‘Heading’ field is displayed in bold and the text you enter in the ‘Text’ field is displayed underneath. 

The primary category you select will be displayed above the post heading in the carousel.

## 404 Posts

The 404 page is shown when a user visit a URL that does not exist on the site. You can select which posts to display on the 404 page by setting the `Show on 404 page?` field to `Yes`.

## Tags for Related Stories

Related Stories can be shown at the bottom of every post and are populated by finding other posts with the same tags, therefore you should ensure you add at least one tag to every post and keep tags consistent to ensure related stories are shown.

## Author Override

By default, when you select an Author for a post their name will be shown on the post and there will be a link their contributions page. If you would like to attribute an author but do not want to create a profile for them you can override the author that is displayed on the post.

To override the author set the author to `aiga_eod_one_off_contributor` and fill the authors name into the Author Override field.

It’s important that you set the author to `aiga_eod_one_off_contributor` otherwise it will show up on the selected authors contributions page.

## Post Ordering

Posts are ordered by their published date in descending order, the newest at the top. If you would like to adjust the order the posts appear then you will need to adjust the published date.

## The ‘Eye’

The site has been configured to automatically insert an eye at the end of the last text paragraph on every post. If the post does not have any content the eye will not be displayed.
