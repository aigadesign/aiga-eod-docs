## Editable pages

There are a number of pages which can be managed through the Pages module of the Wordpress admin:

+ About
+ Terms and Conditions

## Placeholder pages

In order to configure specific pages, placeholder pages had to be created in the Wordpress admin. It is very important you do not delete these pages as they will make them inaccessible on the website.

+ Archive
+ Contributors

Even changing the name or slug of these pages might break the front-end of the website.
