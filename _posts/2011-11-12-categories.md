## Managing Categories

Categories are managed via Categories under posts categories.

Parent categories are shown in the header navigation, if you add another category it will break the navigation because the navigation items have been absolutely positioned.

Child categories in the navigation underneath their parent category. If you add too many child categories it will most likely break the layout so please check after adding new child categories.

The order of parent and child categories can be managed using the Taxonomy Order settings found underneath the posts item in the admin menu.

## Multiple categories on a single post

You can safely assign multiple categories to a post and then select the ‘Primary Category’ as the one that displays with the post title.

By assigning multiple categories the post will appear on multiple category pages.
